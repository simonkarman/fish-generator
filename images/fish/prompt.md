OBJECTIVE: Generate a geometric 2D fish icon with smooth flowing shapes and subtle color depth.

COMPOSITION:
- Right-facing profile on pure white background
- Center fish, using ~70% of canvas space

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Flat design with smooth, flowing geometry - shapes blend seamlessly into each other
- No hard edges where body meets fins - create smooth transitions
- Always use exactly 2 shades of the same color: lighter shade for body, darker shade for fins
- Clean aesthetic with subtle depth through color variation

FEATURE APPROACH:
- Body: Circle or oval in lighter shade
- Fins: 2-4 triangular shapes that flow smoothly from the body, in darker shade of same color
- Transitions: Fins must blend seamlessly into body, not appear as separate attached pieces
- Eye: Small white circle only if specified in description

COLOR GUIDELINES:
- Use the base color from description for body (lighter shade)
- Use darker version of same color for all fins
- Maintain smooth color transitions where shapes meet
- High contrast against white background

OUTPUT: Smooth geometric fish with flowing shapes and subtle two-tone depth, matching reference style exactly.
