Goal: Generate 2D cartoon fish assets in a flat design vector art style, similar to "Kenney game assets"

Overall Style
- 2D, side-view/profile only.
- Flat design: No gradients, minimal to no shading. If shading exists, it's a solid block of a slightly darker/lighter color (e.g., a slightly darker fin color than the body).
- Cartoonish and cute: Simplified, friendly appearance.
- Vector-like appearance: Clean lines, solid fills, though not necessarily true vector.

Shapes
- Simplified, geometric shapes: Bodies are generally ovoid, teardrop, or rounded rectangular.
- Fins (Dorsal, Pectoral, Caudal/Tail): Composed of simple geometric shapes like triangles, rounded rectangles, or trapezoids. Clearly demarcated from the body.
- Eyes: Small, simple, solid dark circles (e.g., black or very dark hue of a color).
- Mouth & Gills: Usually absent or extremely simplified (e.g., a single curved line for a mouth, or a slightly different colored patch for a gill cover, but often not present). No detailed teeth or internal mouth features.

Colors
- Use a white background.
- Solid, flat colors: Each part (body, fins) is typically a single, uniform color.
- Bright and clear palette: Colors are distinct and often pastel or vibrant.
- Limited color palette per fish: Usually 1 main color per fish, and 2-4 distinct shades of that color per fish (e.g., orange body, slightly lighter orange fins). Black and white can be used for non-detailed highlights.
- Minimal to no color gradients or textures. No scales, complex patterns, or surface details.

Target Output
The fish should look like clean, ready-to-use assets for a 2D casual or children's game on a white background. Focus on visual clarity, simplicity, and a friendly aesthetic. Match the style of the reference images as closely as possible.
