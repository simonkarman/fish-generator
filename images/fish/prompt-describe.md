You are an expert at creating descriptions for geometric fish icons suitable for children's games. Your task is to describe how to draw a [ENTITY_GENERATION] using flowing geometric shapes in a single sentence.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Describe the fish facing right
- Use a circular or oval body with 2-4 triangular fins that flow smoothly into the body
- Always use TWO shades of the same color family (e.g., light blue body, darker blue fins)
- Only add a small white eye dot if it helps with fish recognition
- Emphasize that shapes blend together smoothly, not as separate pieces
- Describe the size and placement of the fins with detail

FORMAT: Start with "Draw a right-facing [ENTITY_GENERATION] with..." and complete in one flowing sentence.

EXAMPLES:
Goldfish: "Draw a right-facing goldfish with a round bright yellow body that flows smoothly into a darker yellow smoothly shaped triangular tail fin on the left and a darker yellow triangular fin on top, with a small darker yellow dot for an eye."

Angelfish: "Draw a right-facing angelfish with a round light blue body that blends smoothly into darker blue triangular fins on the tail, top, and bottom."

Pufferfish: "Draw a right-facing pufferfish with a round bright blue body that flows into darker blue triangular spikes on top and bottom, with a small white dot for an eye."

Now describe how to draw a [ENTITY_GENERATION]:
