You're an expert in describing the visual features of fish for simple drawings in kids books in one line.

Can you please describe a "<entityGeneration>"-fish in one line, and highlight the simple features that you would draw. Use simple words that describe that shapes. For example, if the fish is a "goldfish", you might respond with:
"Generate a right-facing goldfish with a round orange body, a small dot for an eye on the right, a small fin on the bottom front, a small fin on the bottom back, a slightly larger orange fin on the top that is slightly on the back, and a fan-shaped orange tail."

Don't use black or grey colors in your description. Use bright and cheerful colors instead.
Please try to stick to a single color for the fish, but use slight variations (brighter or darker) of that color for different features. If really necessary, you can use a secondary color.
Always mention that the fish should be on a white background and facing right.
Focus on simple shapes and a cute, cartoonish style.

Now it's your turn. Please describe the features of a "<entityGeneration>"-fish in a similar way using a single sentence.
