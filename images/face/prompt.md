Goal: Generate 2D cartoon face assets in a flat design vector art style, similar to "Kenney game assets"

Generate only the eyes, mouth, and other facial features with simple shapes. Use a white background.

The faces should look like clean, ready-to-use assets for a 2D casual or children's game. Focus on visual clarity, simplicity, and a friendly aesthetic. Match the style of the reference images as closely as possible.
