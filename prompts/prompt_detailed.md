# Generate 2D cartoon fish assets in a **flat design vector art style**, similar to **"Kenney game assets"**

**Key Characteristics:**

1.  **Overall Style:**
    *   **2D, side-view/profile only.**
    *   **Flat design:** No gradients, minimal to no shading. If shading exists, it's a solid block of a slightly darker/lighter color (e.g., a slightly darker fin color than the body).
    *   **Cartoonish and cute:** Simplified, friendly appearance.
    *   **Vector-like appearance:** Clean lines, solid fills, though not necessarily true vector.

2.  **Shapes & Forms:**
    *   **Simplified, geometric shapes:** Bodies are generally ovoid, teardrop, or rounded rectangular.
    *   **Fins (Dorsal, Pectoral, Caudal/Tail):** Composed of simple geometric shapes like triangles, rounded rectangles, or trapezoids. Clearly demarcated from the body.
    *   **Eyes:** Small, simple, solid dark circles (e.g., black or very dark grey). Occasionally a tiny white dot for a highlight, but often just a solid circle.
    *   **Mouth & Gills:** Usually absent or extremely simplified (e.g., a single curved line for a mouth, or a slightly different colored patch for a gill cover, but often not present). No detailed teeth or internal mouth features.

3.  **Colors:**
    *   **Solid, flat colors:** Each part (body, fins) is typically a single, uniform color.
    *   **Bright and clear palette:** Colors are distinct and often vibrant, but can also include more muted tones like the grey eel.
    *   **Limited color palette per fish:** Usually 1-3 distinct colors per fish (e.g., orange body, slightly lighter orange fins).
    *   **Examples of color schemes:**
        *   Orange body, lighter orange fins.
        *   Light blue-grey body, slightly darker grey fins.
        *   Green body, slightly darker green fins.
        *   Brown top, beige bottom (pufferfish).
        *   Blue body, slightly darker blue fins.

4.  **Outlines:**
    *   **Thick, prominent, dark outlines:** All shapes are clearly defined by a consistent, relatively thick outline.
    *   **Outline color:** Typically black or a very dark, near-black color.

5.  **Details & Texture:**
    *   **Minimal to no texture:** No scales, complex patterns, or surface details.
    *   The pufferfish has simple, short, spike-like protrusions, also with thick outlines.

**Target Output:**
The fish should look like clean, ready-to-use assets for a 2D casual or children's game. Focus on visual clarity, simplicity, and a friendly aesthetic. Avoid realism, complex anatomical details, or intricate shading.
